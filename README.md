# Sogol's TDR4M Classwork

**Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
I am hoping to familiarize myself with the field of robotics, and different mechanisms.

**What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.
One application that I really like working with is spotify. I believe the app is really user friendly and easy to work with.
